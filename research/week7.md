#### Most Important Aspect of MedChat: Agents

- **Objective**: Enhance healthcare delivery through intelligent agents that leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

#### Agentic RAG

- **Definition**: Combines retrieval-augmented generation with agent-based frameworks to perform complex tasks, integrating both generative capabilities and domain-specific knowledge.
- **Purpose**: Automate workflows, interpret complex data, and provide actionable insights in healthcare.

#### Key Frameworks and Methods

1. **Langgraph**
   - **Description**: Uses knowledge graphs to provide contextually rich and precise answers.
   - **Application**: Build conversational agents that understand medical terminology and provide detailed explanations.

2. **CrewAI**
   - **Description**: Manages multiple agents to collaborate with humans and AI systems for task performance.
   - **Application**: Handle different aspects of patient care such as scheduling, dietary advice, and monitoring patient vitals.

3. **Autogen**
   - **Description**: Generates automated workflows using AI, integrating machine learning models with rule-based systems.
   - **Application**: Automate analysis of patient data, generate diagnostic reports, and recommend treatment plans.

#### Use Cases for MedChat Agents
